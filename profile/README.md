# ScholarLedger - Empowering Academic Integrity with Blockchain Technology

## :warning: :construction: Under Active Development :construction: :warning:

The ScholarLedger project is still in early stages and very much a work in progress. More features will be added,
docs may be missing or outdated and api/config may change.

## Introduction
ScholarLedger is a blockchain-based platform designed to support the peer review process for academic institutions. It uses Substrate to create a private, permissioned blockchain network that enhances the integrity and efficiency of validating research papers.

## Purpose
The purpose of ScholarLedger is to leverage blockchain technology and potential AI enhancements to assist organizations in managing the validation of research papers effectively. This system is intended for deployment within an internal network of trusted nodes at organizations that handle research paper validation.

## Features
- **Decentralized Peer Review System**: Automates and records the peer review process on a blockchain.
- **Secure Paper Storage**: Ensures that all submissions are stored securely and immutably.
- **Substrate Blockchain**: Provides a robust and flexible framework for customizing the blockchain to fit organizational needs.
- **Frontend dApp**: Facilitates easy interaction with the blockchain system for users.

## Sub-projects
- **Node**: This is the ScholarLedger [node](https://github.com/ScholarLedger/node) implementation, a Substrate node based on [Polkadot SDK Solochain Template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-solochain-template).
- **dApp**: The frontend [dApp](https://github.com/ScholarLedger/dapp), the entry point for all system users.

## Development Roadmap
### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (PoC)
- Develop core blockchain logic for secure document handling.
- Implement basic functionality for document submission and cryptographic verification.
- Implement a basic peer review process.

### Version 1: Sofisticated peer review, storage and dApp
- Expand features to include comprehensive document management and validation.
- Integrate additional blockchain-based functionalities for enhanced academic collaboration and peer review.
- Implement a user-friendly interface tailored for academic users (dApp).

### Version 2: AI based plagiarism detection
- Planned integration of AI to enhance plagiarism detection and paper analysis.

## Decentralized Computing and Blockchain Benefits
Utilizing decentralized computing with blockchain technology is foundational to SPEEM, making it ideal for environments such as universities and research centers. As validators, these institutions help secure and maintain the network, enhancing trust and transparency. Benefits include:
- **Immutability**: Ensures academic records cannot be altered after being recorded.
- **Transparency**: Provides visibility into the lifecycle of each document.
- **Security**: Protects against unauthorized access and fraud using advanced cryptographic techniques.
- **Decentralization**: Empowers institutions of a the same umbrella organisation to participate in validation process, removing the single point of failure problem and democratizing academic content management.

Substrate's advanced blockchain framework supports these decentralized applications, offering the flexibility and robustness needed for ScholarLedger.

## Contributions
SPEEM is currently a work in progress. We are excited about community contributions! While the initial development up to v1 is being carried out internally, we eagerly anticipate and welcome community contributions post-v1 release. Once there, please feel free to fork the repository, and prepare pull requests for features you believe would enhance the SPEEM toolkit.
